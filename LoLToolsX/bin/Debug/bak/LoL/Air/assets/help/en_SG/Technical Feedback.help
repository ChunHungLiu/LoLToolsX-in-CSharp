Technical Feedback
<font color='#0099ff' size='18'>Technical Feedback</font><br><br><p>If you ever run into a technical issue with the game, please don't hesitate to let us know.  The best way to provide technical feedback is to submit your logs through the PVP.net preferences menu in the top right corner of PVP.net.</p><br><p>What is a log? Logs are a record of events that occur on your computer in relation to the League of Legends launcher, PVP.net, and the League of Legends game itself. The lists of these events are kept in different log files in the Garena Messenger directory on your hard drive.</p><br><p>Once in the PVP.net preferences menu, you can select "Submit Logs to Garena" to send us this helpful information, along with your own descripting of the problem. When describing the issue, please be as specific as possible. The descriptions of the problems you provide are just as important as the logs themselves.</p><br><p>While we can't respond to every log submission personally, the feedback you provide is closely reviewed by our staff.  Your feedback is essential in helping us determine and resolve the problems that need our attention.</p>
