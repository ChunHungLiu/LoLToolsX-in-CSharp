<font color='#0099ff' size='18'>Masteries</font><br><br><p>Masteries can be applied in PVP.net to improve your champions in game.  To access your mastery page, click the “Summoner Profile” link in the upper right hand corner, then select the Masteries tab.</p><br><p>There are three trees in the mastery system: offense, defense, and utility.  Each tree focuses on different kinds of statistics that will apply to your champions in game.  You can hover over masteries with your cursor to learn how that particular skill will affect your champion in game.</p><br><p>You will notice how some masteries are colored and others are grayed out.  The colored masteries can be obtained by clicking the icon to spend one of your mastery points.  The grayed out masteries in a tree must be unlocked by spending points in the masteries above them.  You will gain additional mastery points when your summoner levels up by playing games.  Be sure to save the mastery tree by selecting “Save Focus” when you’re finished.</p><br><p>If you ever want to reset your mastery tree and start over, select “Return Points” and all of your mastery points will be refunded without any penalty.</p><br><p>You can also set masteries during champion select before a game starts.  Make sure to save the masteries before the countdown ends, or your masteries won’t be applied when you enter the game.</p>
