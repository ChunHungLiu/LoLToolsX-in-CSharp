A "global ban" means that no player, regardless of which team they are on, can choose that champion during the upcoming champion selection process. The bans are chosen in a 1:2:1 format, meaning the first team chooses one champion to ban, the second team chooses two champions, then the first team chooses the final champion.ºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøº</p><br><font color='#0099ff' size='15'>ºøDrafting Championsøº</font><br><p>ºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøAfter bans have been decided, each team takes turns choosing their champions for the upcoming match. In Draft Mode, you can immediately see the champion an opposing team member has picked. This allows you to make strategic champion choices in reaction to your enemy's. The champion selection process follows a 1:2:2:2:2:1 or a 1:2:2:1 format for 3v3 and 5v5 games, respectively. This means the team that picks first chooses one champion, followed by the second team picking two champions, then the first team picking two champions, and so on.øºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøº</p><br><font color='#0099ff' size='15'>ºøSelecting Your Championºøº</font><br><p>ºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøWhen it's your turn to pick a champion, your portrait will be highlighted orange. Be ready for your turn because you'll only have a limited amount of time to pick your champion. If you make your final choice before the timer runs out, you can select 'Lock In Your Choices' to skip to the next player's turn, but once your champion is 'locked' you can't go back.øºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøº</p>
