Ranked Games
<font color='#0099ff' size='18'>Ranked Games</font><br><br><p>Ranked Games are a game type made especially for competitive players. Accordingly, only summoners that reach the maximum summoner level of 30 are able to participate, and all Ranked Games use Draft Mode to select champions.</p><br><font color='#0099ff' size='15'>Joining a Ranked Game</font><br><p>Joining a Ranked Game works in a similar way to joining a Normal Game, by clicking the red 'Play' button at the top of PVP.net, but in Ranked Games you can only search for a game in one of three ways:</p><br><ul><li>Search by yourself, or with one other friend, for a 5v5 match on Summoner's Rift</li><li>Search with 4 other friends for a 5v5 match on Summoner's Rift</li><li>Search with 2 other friends for a 3v3 match on Twisted Treeline</li></ul><br><p>After choosing the type of Ranked Game you want, you will search for a game with players of similar skill level, just like Normal Games. However, unlike Normal Games, only players searching for games in the same way you chose to search are eligible for you to be matched with; players searching without a team of five can only be matched with other players searching alone, or with only one other friend.</p><br><font color='#0099ff' size='15'>Ladders</font><br><p>One advantage to playing in Ranked Games is it gives you the ability to see how you measure up against your competition. All ranked games are tracked on our ladders website where every player has a player profile that can be viewed by anyone.</p>
